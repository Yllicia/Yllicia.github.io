<!-- 
    Allows you to search everything on google without worrying about your search history.
    This page is just displaying google, you can do everything you want just like the real website but the url won't change so even if someone finds your search history there's no way to know what you searched for.

    This works on Google Chrome, I've tried on Firefox but it doesn't work.
